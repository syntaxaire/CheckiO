"""
 You are given a text, which contains different english letters and punctuation
 symbols. You should find the most frequent letter in the text. The letter
 returned must be in lower case. While checking for the most wanted letter,
 casing does not matter, so for the purpose of your search, "A" == "a". Make
 sure you do not count punctuation symbols, digits and whitespaces, only
 letters.

If you have two or more letters with the same frequency, then return the letter
which comes first in the latin alphabet. For example -- "one" contains "o", "n",
"e" only once for each, thus we choose "e".

Input: A text for analysis as a string (unicode for py2.7).

Output: The most frequent letter in lower case as a string.

Precondition:
A text contains only ASCII symbols.
